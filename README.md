This Python project implements a text-based version of the classic Connect Four game. The game is played on a 6x7 grid where two players take turns dropping their pieces into columns.

Players input a column number (1-7) to place their piece.

The game continues until one player achieves a winning combination or the entire board is filled, resulting in a tie.

Win and tie conditions are automatically checked.
The game board is represented by a 2D list.
